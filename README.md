# Kijk â€“ a praat plugin to viasualise articulatory trajectories

*Kijk* was conceptualised as an open tool and straightforward alternative to the quick visualization of kinematic trajectories collected via electromagnetic articulography (EMA) in [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). The plugin can be used as a script or it can be added to Praat's dynamic menu. So far, it works for EMA data collected with the NDI Wave and Carsten's AG501 devices.
