# Kijk – a praat plugin to visualize articulatory trajectories

*Kijk* was conceptualised as an open tool and straightforward alternative to the quick visualization of kinematic trajectories collected via electromagnetic articulography (EMA) in [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). The plugin can be used as a script or it can be added to Praat's dynamic menu. So far, it works for EMA data collected with the NDI Wave and Carsten's AG501 devices.

Further description and usage can be found [here](https://github.com/linsca/kijk/blob/main/kijk-paper.pdf).

## UPDATES
#### v0.2 (22 August 2023)
- New functionality allows the use of tables with custom headers. Check "Custom table" in the form, input sensor name(s), and dimension(s) as in data. For example, if your header is "TT_X" enter TT in "sensor name" and X in "dimension". Sensor numbers are unused.
